  <h1 class="h4_q3"> make light of me.” But if Whitman were writing this today, he thinks the lamppost might say, “I’m much more classy than neon or new-fangled LEDs.”</h1>
  <h1 class="h1i_q4_h1h_q3"> When Whitman became editor of the Brooklyn Eagle in 1846, he focused on local news, writing a column every day. But he also used the paper as a platform for political opinions about immigration, labor issues, and more. In 1848, when the US government was debating whether new territory won in the Mexican-American War should allow slavery, Whitman argued fiercely in favor of free soil. Since the newspaper owner was pro-slavery, Whitman was fired for his anti-slavery views.
Soon after, Whitman turned from journalism to poetry, beginning work on his masterpiece, Leaves of Grass, a collection of poems about nature, democracy, and love. It includes </h1>

<h1 class="f_q4">Whitman’s friend Gabriel Harrison seems to have been pulled into modern-day Brooklyn as part of the same space-time anomaly, and was last spotted by local residents in Brooklyn Bridge Park. Harrison was an artist, actor, playwright, photographer, and social activist — a 19th-century James Franco. He opened a photography studio on Fulton Street in 1852, and took the photo of Whitman that was used in the first edition of Leaves of Grass. Harrison believes that Whitman was a poetic genius, saying “A true Bard of Brooklyn, never has another poet let out such a powerful, eternal barbaric yawp!”</h1>
